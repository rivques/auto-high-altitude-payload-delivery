## Basics
### Design purpose and sucess statement:
* The intent of this design is to create a box that can connect to the bottom of a drone and hold the electronics for all of our various components and also hold the dropping cargo.
* This design is succesful if: everything fits right without filing or scraping, all the components of the in-sky module can fit inside without interference, it is lightweight enough for the drone to comfortably move with good dexterity, and the cargo can be dropped at any time.

* The hinges were too tight on the bolt that held them in place, therefore they would be unable to open due to just gravity.
* The big hole on the side of the back wall is designed to be an opening for the sd card reader and writer and it was mismeasured
* The holes that were intended to screw into the hinges interfered with the box's brackets.
