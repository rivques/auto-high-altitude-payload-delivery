# Cargobay Docs
## Basics
### Design purpose and sucess statement:
* The intent of this design is to create a box that can connect to the bottom of a drone and hold the electronics for all of our various components and also hold the dropping cargo.
* This design is succesful if: everything fits right without filing or scraping, all the components of the in-sky module can fit inside without interference, it is lightweight enough for the drone to comfortably move with good dexterity, and the cargo can be dropped at any time.
### Timeline:

## Design
###  The box consists of three main components:
* The physical box (All laser cut)
* The addons (Hinges, Servo mount, and the hatch lock)
* The landing gear

### The Box
<details>
<summary>Trials and errors of the box </summary>

### The box went through two renditions plus a couple renovations.
[Originally the box looked like this:]()
The problems with this box:
* The door on the side is intened for access to the wires. When put together there wasn't enough space to do what it was designed for: Accessing the wires with the ability to change them around.
* There was no switch hole
* You couldnt access the USB port on the microprocessor without taking it out.
* The hinges were too tight on the bolt that held them in place, therefore they would be unable to open due to just gravity.
* The big hole on the side of the back wall is designed to be an opening for the SD card reader and writer and it was mismeasured
* The holes that were intended to screw into the hinges interfered with the box's brackets.

### Current box:
* The laser-cut box is a two-section container with a center wall to prevent interference between the cargo and electronics.
* The electronics bay is comprised of a [] a battery pack and a raspberry pico.
* The wholes on the box are size #4-40 for the labs screws and #1-72 for the small ones
* The large whole on the electronics bay door is the lock. The point of the design is to be able to wrap a wire into the electronics bay side wall and twist it shut.
