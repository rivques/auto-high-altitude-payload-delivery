I have mixed feelings about this project. Our final project is so little of our initial plan, and we were entirely unable to integrate a team member's work
(Jakob's ground station) due to time issues. On the other hand, we made an objectively cool thing, and learned a lot about how not to fly a payload on a drone.
I got experience with LoRa, which was new to me, and which will probably feature in future projects. I think that part of the reason we went slower than I thought
we would is that I didn't devote as much time outside of class to this as I was initially expecting to, so our estimates were off.
